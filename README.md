============

How annoying is it for you to remember that you are indebted to someone, but you can't remember by how much?

Even more annoying, what if you told that person you already paid "some" of the money you owed and will pay the "rest" of it later, but you can't remember the "some" amount?

I'm sure you find that annoying. Well, that makes both of us.

But then I (and probably you) thought, "Alright, I'll take note of these things using my phone!"

That's all great and fancy, but then  I found out that writing the note to my phone itself is annoying because I have to fight the damn keyboard to type it correctly.

So finally, here's what I thought: "Fuck this, I'm gonna use the damn voice recognition and let it do the hard work for us.

Of course, just using the voice recognition won't do anything, because the data needs to be processed to translate whatever gibberish we told the voice recognizer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So for example, you could say this to the application: "owed THISDUDE 100000 dollars for grocery" (Expensive, I know)
And this sentence is translated as:

Date: (when it's created)
Debtor: THISDUDE
Money Owed: $100000
Details: Grocery

To extend this example further, few days later, you paid him 10k because you're not rich enough, but you promise him that you will pay the rest at the end of this month.

For this, you could say: "paid THISDUDE 10000 dollars for grocery"
Continuing from previous entry this will result in:

Date: (when it's created)
Debtor: THISDUDE
Money Owed: $90000
Details: Grocery

On the judgement day (aka the promised payment day), you forgot how much you paid him before because you paid him in CASH! (10k dollar in cash, crazy I know) even worse, he can't remember either and there's no receipt!

Well, this application comes and saves the day for both of you! (well, depends on how you look at it, I guess)

What's that you say? The application misheard what you said? Well, you can try again or fix it manually using keyboard (so keyboard is not completely useless, and hey, you don't have to type as much anymore!)

And there you go, this is the application I'm designing right now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shitty? Seems impractical? Well, you might be right, but I thought this is kinda important for myself, since I'm a forgetful person. And if I can help other people who have similar problem to mine, then why not make this app anyway? (even though I'm not even in thirties yet)

I gotta admit though, I'm not sure if someone already made this app in play store.
But then again, this app is an excuse for me to learn programming Android!

If you have suggestions, tell me so!
You can send me hate messages, but man, why you gotta do hurt my feeling man. Shit hurts if it's not constructive.

tl;dr of main desc : This application is for debt bookkeeping.
tl;dr of main feature: Fuck virtual keyboard, use voice recognition and let the damn application do all the bookkeeping hard work for us.
